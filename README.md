## Description

VPBooklet is a light-weight, extensible, HTML5/JS/CSS3 application framework.

## Usage

VPBooklet.js provides a base VPController object prototype. VPController instances can be used to manage user interface views, and they provide support for outlets and actions associated with elements within those views. Views can be held within HTML files, or they can be defined programatically. The design allows for web apps to be written following the MVC paradigm.

VPBooklet was initially design to aid the development of apps for iOS and Android, however it can also be used for apps running within desktop browsers too.

## Notes

VPBooklet is a family of libraries, the heart of which is the VPController class (in VPBooklet.js) and the VPUtils.js utility library. There are other libraries that are members of this family, such as VPSlider.js and VPTabbed.js, which we will be releasing soon.

Basic documentation will be added soon, as will some basic code examples.

## Real-life Examples

VPBooklet is the technology behind several apps on the iTunes and Google Play stores.

* [The Blur App](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-blur-app/id545492189?mt=8)
* [FairFX app for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fairfx/id535758572?mt=8)
* [FairFX app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fairfx.retail.org&hl=en)

There are several more apps that use VPBooklet that will be released soon, and we will add more details about them when we can.

On the web, the Tinie Tempah Demonstration album promo site is powered by VPBooklet, which also makes use of our animation library collection, VPAnimEngine.

## Compatibility

VPBooklet requires a modern browser environment in which to run, one in which HTML5, CSS3, and ECMAScript 5 are supported. Practically speaking this means most versions of Safari and Chrome, recent versions of Firefox (from late 2012 onwards), and IE 10.

It is possible to use VPBooklet in older environments through the use of compatibility shims and/or polyfills. For example, loading a [classList polyfill](https://github.com/remy/polyfills/blob/master/classList.js) will allow VPBooklet apps to run inside IE 9.
